<div>
    Provides a dynamic parameter listing to allow a user to select a value
    from a list of currently available Symbolic Names (Tags and Branches)
    in a CVS Repository.

    The list of symbolic names is generated using the CVS RLOG command so any
    use of this parameter could cause delays in loading the parameter selection
    page at the start of the build whilst the repository processes this command.
